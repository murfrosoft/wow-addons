# wow-addons
Repository for custom World of Warcraft Addons

### Instructions:
1. Download the zipped directory
2. Unzip
3. Navigate into the wow-addons-master directory to find the Murf_Addon folder
4. Copy/Move the Murf_Addon folder into your \World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns directory.

At this point you should be able to enable the addon via WoW iterface.  The Addon provides a small window that keeps track of number of mob kills (really, any exp-generating event) and estimates remaining kills to next level.  A level 60 character probably won't get any use of this item because at 60 no exp-generating events occur.
